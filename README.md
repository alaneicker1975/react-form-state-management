# React Form Architecture

This repo demonstrates how to architect a form-based application using:

- Formik: to handle form state
- FormProvider: to create the Formik instance and share for form state across the component tree
- Form model: to store the form field props and validators

### Setup

```
npm install && npm run start
```
